  In this version we have included an utility program hrotor version 2.0.  
You can use the compiling and linking commands listed in the section 17 of the
POLYRATE on-line manual to make an executable file detmi.exe for your machine.
This utility program calculates the reduced moment of inertia and the partition
functions of a hindered-rotor. The program reads data from Unix standard
input and write data to Unix standard output. All the input data are in free
format. To make a data file follow the steps below:

    1. In the first line you have to input 4 numbers in free format.

       The first number is the number of atoms in the molecule.

       The second number specifies the unit of the position vector you are
       going to input. Set it to 0 if you use bohrs, to 1 if you use angstroms.

       The third number specifies the coordinate system of the vibrational
       eigenvector you are going to input. Set it to 0 if you use mass scaled
       coordinate system, to 1 if you use cartesian coordinate system.

       The fourth number specifies the number of temperatures you want to 
       calculate the partition function at. 

       For example, if the target molecule is the saddle point of of reaction
       in the POLYRATE cwmc test run and your position vector is in bohrs, and
       the eigenvector is in mass-scaled coordinate, and you want to calculate 
       the partition function at two temperatures, the first line should look
       like the following:

       9  0  0  2

    2. The second and the third lines are the calculation titles. You can
       write whatever you want here (less than 80 characters in one line).

       For example:

       Saddle point of the reaction in cwmc test runs 
       The reduced moment of inertia and the partition function

    3. The next line is the scaling mass of the mass-scaled coordinate system
       if you set the third number in the first line to 0, otherwise go to
       step 4.

    4. The next n lines, where n is the first number you entered in the first
       line, contain the atomic masses of the constituient atoms in a.m.u.
 
    5. The next n lines, where n is the first number you entered in the first
       line, contains the position vector of the molecule in (unscaled) 
       cartesian coordinates. There should be 3 numbers in a line, the X, Y, and
       Z coordinates of the atom. See the sample file cwmc.rmi in this
       directory.
       
    6. The next n lines, where n is the first number you entered in the first
       line, contains the vibrational eigenvector of this hindered-rotor
       mode. There should be 3 numbers in a line, the X, Y, and Z components of
       the eigenvector of the atom corresponding to this line. See the sample
       file cwmc.rmi in this directory.

    7. The next line contains the symmetry and subgroup information. The first
       number is the symmetry factor of this hindered rotation. The second
       number is the number of atoms in one of the subgroup. The next m numbers,
       where m is the second number in this line, are the atom indices of those
       atoms in that subgroup.

    8. The next line specifies the chemical bond that separates thoese
       two subgroups. Two numbers need to be input in this line.  These numbers
       are the indices of the atoms that form the bond.  Note that this line
       is not needed in the previous version of hrotor.f program.

    9. If you decide to calculate the partition function (the fourth number
       in the first line is set greater than 0) you need to input the harmonic
       frequency in a new line, and the temperatures in kelvin you need in the
       next line. See the sample file cwmc.rmi.
