  In version 5.0 we have included an utility program detmi. You can use 
the compiling and linking commands listed in the section 17 of the POLYRATE
on-line manual to make an executable file detmi.exe for your machine. This 
utility program has two functions:

    1. It reads in the geometry in cartesians of a molecule and the atomic
       masses of the atoms that the molecule consists of, then it calculates
       and prints the determinant of the moment of inertia of the molecule.

    2. It interconverts the geometry in bohrs and the geometry in angstroms.
       This feature is particularly useful when you get a geometry in bohrs
       and want to use it as an input geometry for some semi-empirical
       electronic structure calculation packages (for example, MOPAC and AMPAC).

  This program is very easy to use, however, you have to remember to do the
following:

    1. Make a data file. The program will read the data from a file called
       detmi.dat. If your data file have a different name, copy (or link) your
       file to this name.

    2. When finished, the program will generate a output file called detmi.out.
       It is highly recommended to move (or copy) this file to another file
       name before doing ant other calculations. Otherwise the new output
       will overwrite the old detmi.out file, and the old information in that
       file will be lost.

    3. There is a simple script detmi.jc in this directory. It can do the above
       for you if you want. It takes the input file name as the only argument. 

       For example, if your data file is called ch4.mi, you can type

       detmi.jc oh4.mi <Return>

       to do the calculation. The output will be written to the file ch4.out. 
 
  How to make an input data file:

    1. In the first line you have to input three numbers in free format.

       The first number is the number of atoms in the molecule.

       The second number specifies that if the geometry of the molecule is
       linear or nonlinear. Set the number to 1 if it is linear. Set the number
       to 0 if the geometry is not linear.

       The third number specifies the input unit for the cartesians. Set it
       to 1 if the unit you use is angstrom. Set the number to 0 if you use
       bohr.

       For example, if the target molecule is methane and your geometry
       data in cartesians is in angstroms, the first line should look like the
       following:

       5  0  1

    2. The second and the third lines are the calculation titles. You can
       write whatever you want here (less than 80 characters in one line).

       For example:

       Methane: CH4 
       QCISD/adj-cc-pvtz geometry

    3. The next n lines, where n is the first number you entered in the first
       line, contain the atomic mass and cartesian coordiante information.
       There should be 4 numbers in one line. The first number is the atomic
       mass in a.m.u. of the atom; the second, third, and fourth numbers are
       the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the atom. See the sample file ch4.mi in
       this directory.
